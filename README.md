# MyFuelCalculator
Swift app to calculate fuel needed in endurance races. It takes length of the race, lap time and fuel usage per lap 
and calculates total amount of fuel needed to finish the race including pace lap and the total amount of laps in the race. Additionally lap fuel usage is saved per track/car combo so it doesn't need to be estimated every time. ECU mappings of every car are also available by tapping the green ECU Map button (and selecting a car prior). Made in Swift as a hobby POC
